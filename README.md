## General info
The main purpose of this project was to learn the Photon framework. 

When the username is chosen, the player can join to room. If there is no room available with free slot, the game creates a new one. After joining, there is kinda sandbox level which is used as a waiting place for the rest of the players for the match begins. Then, when the true game level is loaded match starts. The game ends when there only one player left. On start, players have a random weapon equipped and need to win with its help. There is no possibility to pick another weapon or to get some ammo so we need to be careful. Available weapons are simple handgun, automatic rifle and shotgun. Weapons are balanced, so there have its press and cons. If there will be no winner after some period of time all players lose.

This project made me lots of fun because get me new problems to solve and enable me to learn lots of new content. The main problem which I was facing really often was synchronization between clients and because of that, I analyzed Photon quite deep.

**The game is not exactly finished in the meaning of the complete project. I made it as a prototype for possible future projects.**
